# SISOverview.

WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THE SIS TO A NEW, EASIER TO USE REPOSITORY. PLEASE CONSIDER MOVING YOUR FOCUS TO

HTTPS://github.com/TeamPracticalProjects/SISProject

This repository contains overview documents that describe the SIS project.  SIS stands for 
"Standalone Intelligent Sensor" system. The documents in this repository explain the SIS concept 
and provide the answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

We are looking for people who are interested in building and using the SIS as we have designed it.  We are
also interested in ideas for expanding the current SIS with additional useful features and we are open to 
ideas for additional applications of the base SIS technology (some ideas are in the Concept document). 
SIS is an open source project and we are interested in improvements that other developers might wish make 
themselves and/or to collaborate with us on.

We are two hobbyists who work on the SIS in our spare time. You don't have to be a hardcore, gung-ho, work 
on it until you drop, kind of person; we certainly aren't. Collaboration could just mean that you'd like 
to have one of these to install and test somewhere. We are open to make changes to the code to fit your need, 
as long as you provide us feedback on how it works and ideas on how to improve it.

Of course collaboration could also mean that you want to add functions to the core firmware or javascript web site. 
That would be cool too.

Send us a message to join in the fun: SISProject@shrimpware.com
